	<h2>Orcs</h2>
	<p>Recent rumours of dangerous orcs on the area of Fangorn are completely untrue. Orcs in the area are all friendly. However it is unwise to feed the orcs.</p>

<h2>Adventure</h2>
	<p>For the more adventurous, we have trail rides taking in all the sights of Rohan. You can camp under the stars while enjoying the 4 night trail ride starting at the spectacular Rauros Falls on the river Anduin, then following the footsteps of the famous Merry and Pippin across the picturesque plains of Rohan. The ride finally arrives at Issengard where you can enjoy the fine dining and soak your trail sore muscles at the natural hot spas.</p>
	<p>The 10 days Caves of Helms Deep tour is for the very fit and brave. Led by our experienced dwarf guides, this trail through the glittering caves is an underground wonderland. Hear the history of the Defence of the Hornburg retold in the very place it happend! After 4 days and night exploring the caves, a 2 day ride takes us to the long valley of Harrowdale and to the entrance of the Paths of the Dead! Warm socks essential.</p>
